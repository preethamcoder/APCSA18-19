//a.It causes a compile error because the class name was changed
//b.There's no error since it is a change in the string and not the code itself
//c.There's an error because the quotation is not complete and the quote can't be printed
//d.There's an error because the string literal is not properly closed by a double quote
//e.There's no syntax error, but only a run-time error
//f.We've used an undefined method instead of a pre-defined print command
//g.This causes a syntax error because a statement in java is incomplete without a semi-colon
//h.It was a run-time error because the code is deemed incomplete without the brace
